# State of the DAO_12-2023

## December 2023 DAO Updates
This month we have been hard at work deploying a number of key initiatives for the DAO to lead us into 2024.  The first and most important is to fulfill on the promise to our members to provide a web3 native token as the framework of our membership.  The second has been to finalize the Member Directory with a new php interface to allow lawyers and professionals to build profiles in our network.  The third has been continued work on refining the website to build upon our existing design and polish the structure so that we can get back to growing as an organization.

In the background, there are also a number of other initiatives at play which we encourage members to participate in.  Comms committee has continued publishing great and engaging content on legal engineering topics.  Our operating committe has been hard at work trying to close out the year's finances.  Grants committee has continued to explore partnerships and funding opportunities to keep the DAO treasury afloat.  We've kicked off conversations about LexDAO formally creating a peer-review journal and have begun to line up speaking engagements to bring the ever-popular Study Group back into the fold. After months of a bear-market, we are hopeful that a strong recovery is just around the corner.

### Token Standard
After searching far and wide we did in fact find a solution for the forseeable future.Historically, the DAO has operated on a variety of platforms and tokens over the years.  The last time we had a working token was in 2022 with an ERC-721 contract created by our former operator Jared Cohen.  While these tokens were an incredible first go at deploying on chain, by 2023 they were in need of a refresh.

Over the course of the year, we explored countless vendors in the space while rigorously researching home grown options to create a new ERC-721 contract.  All of the research and specifications for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/cimplylimited/LexDAO-MembershipToken-2023).  After searching far and wide for a solution, we finally came across [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/) which has built its business entirely on time-based NFTs.  Unlock allows us to build all of our token requirements into verified contracts and facilitate a smooth checkout for our members to self-mint.  As an added benefit it is also open sourced which goes hand in hand with LexDAO's operating philosophy.

The token comes with a number of key benefits and meets the vast majority of our baseline specifications.  For one, the token is time based, allowing us to issue tokens to members with a self-mint and have the tokens expire at the end of one year from purchase.  These tokens will not burn, they will simply return an expired response from the contract, so the member can keep their member card in their wallet.  It also facilitates renewals so that members can renew their memberships indefinitely.  Through the configuration of the token, we have ensured these are non-transferrable, which is critical to the philosophy of one member, one vote and to the idea of continuing to build a professional organization.  The metadata is comprehensive allowing us to include reference to all kinds of attributes and links to our key documents.  It is also updateable, and it makes it simple for us to administrate the token as the base infrastructure for future engineering projects for our network.

The artwork for the membership token is an homage to both the origins of LexDAO as well as the future of the DAO.  Using artwork created for our website by Andres Dovales, a long-time DAO member and core contributor, we painstakingly recreated our original logo and then overlayed it with a fresh palette.  We hope that the members will appreciate the hard work that went into the design of the NFT artwork and the care we took to preserve the DAO's roots.

This 721 token is only the beginning as we have been exploring the concept of network tokens through an 1155 protocol known as [Hats](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/).  The general idea is that the member token will be read by a network of 1155 tokens to authorize access to the network.  From there, we will be able to build out roles based authorizations that can be plugged into our applications throughout our network.  We like to think of this in a similar way to database roles and groups where committee membership, member qualifications, manager roles, and application permissions can all be managed with an organized and nested on-chain solution.

We are also exploring the revamp of our Legal Engineering certificate, known as LEETH.  This will hopefully help us to create a peer-group of Legal Engineers that have demonstrated their proficiency in the practice of web3 law, engineering, or both.  At the moment, most of our efforts are centered around compiling old contracts for the previously minted LEETH Tokens, researching the legacy qualifications, and putting together a working group to help build V2 of this important DAO offering.  As we continue to build our technical chops, we hope to be a sounding board, forum, and industry resource to companies and individuals as they embark on building solutions in this still nascent space.


### Member Directory
After many months we have been able to rebuild the member directory from the ground up to incorporate basic member profiles as well as to allow users to contact people directly through the web interface.  We've connected this to the member signup flow to make it more seamless for users to apply for membership and to be listed.  As the directory continues to build out we are going to look at various ways to incorporate certifications and token roles into the member directory.  For now, we hope to continue to build organizational value by allowing users to find professionals who can help them with their web3 challenges.  At first we plan to offer this as a free service to people who renew their membership early and then eventually begin charging a fee for being listed.  The member directory is a resource open to all current members and we encourage you to sign up.

### Website
The website has been in beta for a few months and much of its development was put on hold to work through the connection of the directory and calendar integration.  While we still have work to do on the LexDAO Calendar, we have connected the site to the member checkout flow and continue to make updates to ensure things are up and running.  As we start getting further into the year, the hope is that we can begin to build new structures on top of this foundation to enhance the value our public profile brings to the community.
