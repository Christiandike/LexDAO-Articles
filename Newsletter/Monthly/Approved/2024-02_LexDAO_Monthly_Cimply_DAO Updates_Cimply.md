### LexDAO Team and Member Meetups
LexDAO has a house near the main event Wednesday through Sunday.  Given the fact that many of us will be attending from all over the world, the Membership Pod has created a Google sheet to help everyone get conected, link up, and meet in person.  If you will be attending and would like to be involved with other members in-person, please put your contact details in the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_MZQ4oiu2T7hvcyuLdusBldQhyapFRg4cPMHWZyLdIk/edit?usp=sharing) and we will all plan to stay in touch.  You can also tag @ops in the discord with any questions.

## LexDAO Budgets
Many of you may have heard that the Grants Committee was able to secure a sizable sum of funds from the most recent Optimism RetroPGF Round.  While the team continues working on getting these funds transferred, the Operating Committee, in partnership with Grants, has begun scaffolding a budget for this funding that continues to support our mission of Law as a Public Good, invests in projects that bring value to our members, and finding new ways to attract and retain talent in the guild.  We have been discussing the allocations actively over the last two weeks and will be finalizing a proposal to the DAO likely the week of March 4th once the hype from ETH Denver is behind us.  For anyone looking to get involved please tag @ops or @grants in our discord or join our weekly governance/grants meetings.

## Lex Education 
### Study Group
Study group has recently restarted hosted under the leadership of Paolo Mario Gangi, an experienced lawyer from Italy and long time LexDAO member working out of Italy.  In Episode 1 we had a panel of 3 crypto legal experts discussing DAO Tax Implications.  The panelists include Magnus Jones (SA Ang Norway, Anish Kamboj (Millard Thompson LLP, Canada),  Jason Schwartz (Fried Frank).  

The conversation starts with a discussion on the implications of taxable events in different international centers.  Conceptually, much of the considerations require assessment of the characteristics of the tokens as either governance or financial instruments.  The discussion also talks a bit around the implications of being connected to the DAO as a leader and how tax authorities might view your involvement.  All of this is bringing attention to the tentative risk and liabilities surrounding the management of the organization.  

If you are looking to start a DAO style organization, this is a great thought starter for how to consider planning around tax structures in how to manage your liability.  Feel free to listen and please join us at our next session in a few weeks.
