# LexDAO Organization

--DRAFT--

## What is LexDAO's Purpose? 

LexDAO is a guild of legal engineering professionals, united to innovate and bring the traditional legal settlement layer to code, and coded agreements to the masses. We believe that everyone deserves access to justice provided in a quick and efficient manner. If legal services were easier to use, verify, and enforce, we could live in a fairer world. Distributed ledger technology offers solutions to many problems in the legal space. 

Our mission is to research, develop and evangelize first-class legal methods and blockchain protocols that secure rules and promises with code rather than trust. We do this by training LexDAO-certified legal engineers and building LexDAO-certified blockchain applications. We strive to balance new deterministic tools with the equitable considerations of law to better serve citizens on a cooperative and nonprofit basis for the primary and mutual benefit of its members and common good.

## What is Legal Engineering?
Legal Engineering is the intersection of code and law. As the world moves further into a digital first environment the overlap between law and software becomes increasingly important.  Integrating legal frameworks into programming presents opportunities to make systems that are less costly, more accessible, and provide people with stronger protections in trustless environments.  Legal Engineering, in many ways, is similar to legal scribes of old, creating applications that build the logic of the law into their operating systems.  In much the same way as Hammurabi's Code made the law of the land available to the world, Legal Engineering ensures that the meaning of today's contracts, legislation, and policy can be folded into day to day life in more scalable ways through software.

Legal Engineering has many potential mediums, both public and private.  Blockchains are a natural fit for public development because of their decentralized nature and because of their permanence. Blockchains provide a place to permanently a host of legally relevant elements such as legal titles, arbitration terms, escrow accounts, and attestations.  That being said, software of any kind, is only a medium for recording processes.  It is only as good as the people who write those processes and the underlying governing logic.  Therefore, it is becomming increasingly important to have legal scholars who are not only proficient in interpreting and drafting process, but scribes who are able to codify those principles into applications that can scale operations and secure them appropriately with trust.
