# A Deep Dive into the Wyoming DUNA
## Introduction
> DAOs are to Corporations what Democracy was to Monarchy — Paulo Fonseca.[1][1]

[Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) are web3 primitives that enables people to coordinate towards a common purpose without a [centralized](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/decentralized-vs-centralized/) governance structure. However, in order for DAOs to thrive in the real world, they require a legal structure (or “[wrapper](https://docs.daobox.io/dao-legal-wrapper-design-and-creation/legal-wrappers-for-daos-definition-types-jurisdictions-and-use-cases)”) that cements their legitimacy.

This article is a deep dive into the Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA), a DAO-specific legal structure established by the state of Wyoming.

The article explains why DAOs need a legal structure and more importantly, a DAO-specific one. We examine the traditional legal structures adopted by DAOs, alongside previous attempts at creating a DAO-specific legal structure. Finally, we take a closer look at the DUNA, its features, how it compares with traditional legal wrappers, and its potential advantages and disadvantages.

## What is the Need for DAO-Specific Legal Structures?
To understand why DAOs require DAO-specific legal structures or legal structures at all, it is necessary to first of all understand three key challenges faced by DAOs:

* **Legal existence**: A DAO needs a legal structure in order to become a [legal entity](https://www.google.com/search?q=separate+legal+personality&rlz=1C5CHFA_enNG1079NG1079&oq=separate+legal+personality&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCTExMDI5ajBqNKgCALACAQ&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and gain legal existence. Without a legal existence, a DAO cannot enter into contracts, own property, sue persons in its own name, and exercise other legal rights.

* **Tax/regulatory compliance**: Without a legal existence, a DAO has no ability to pay taxes or effectively comply with regulations.

* **Liability of members**: A legal existence allows a DAO to become separate from its members so that they cannot be held personally [liable](https://www.sumup.com/en-gb/invoices/dictionary/limited-liability/) for the DAOs activities.

DAOs generally address these challenges in two ways:
1. **Entityless structure**: Many DAOs operate without any legal structure or as a non-legal entity. Adopting this structure leaves DAOs exposed to all three of the aforementioned challenges.

2. **Legal Entity Structure**: This entails adopting different kinds of established legal structures that confer DAOs with legal existence. These structures range from the less common [Corporation](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/what-is-corporation-overview/), [Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations (UNAs)](https://ballotpedia.org/Unincorporated_nonprofit_association), and [Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-is-a-limited-liability-company.html), to the more commonly adopted offshored Foundation structure, which warrants a closer look. The Foundation structure combines features of a corporation and a Trust and provides DAOs with several benefits: legal existence, limited liability for members, the ability to engage in profit and nonprofit activities, and even no taxes. 

While DAOs can generally piggyback on any one of these legal entity structures, they are generally unsatisfactory because they require significant human input, are highly complex, expensive, and create uncertainty for DAOs in terms of tax/regulatory compliance. Most importantly, these legal structures are not DAO-specific. 

## What were Previous Attempts at Creating DAO-Specific Legal Structures?
### DAO LLCs
Prior to the DUNA, the DAO LLC has been the only significant attempt at creating a legal structure tailored for DAOs.

A [limited liability company (LLC)](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-is-a-limited-liability-company.html) is similar to a corporation in the sense that it establishes a business as a separate legal entity, thereby shielding its members from personal liability for the business. However, like an unincorporated entity, an LLC is a [pass-through entity](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/should-you-form-a-pass-through-entity.html) for tax purposes. The profits of an LLC are [attributed](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/how-are-profits-split-in-an-llc) to its members who are then individually taxed, with the LLC itself not being taxable. The laws of certain jurisdictions allow DAOs to adopt the LLC structure, with some additional features. Under [Wyoming’s DAO Supplement](https://sos.wyo.gov/Forms/WyoBiz/DAO_Supplement.pdf), in addition to the general LLC features, DAO LLCs cannot not be [manager-managed](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/member-managed-llcs-versus-manager-managed-llcs.html), and the [fiduciary duties](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/1-107-5744?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true) of members to the DAO can be waived. DAO LLCs and their equivalents are similarly available under the laws of [Tennessee](https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/112/Amend/HA0748.pdf), [Utah](https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/HB0357.html#48-5-406), [Vermont](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/11/025/04173) and [Marshall Islands](https://rmiparliament.org/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/202/2022-050/DecentralizedAutonomousOrganizationAct2022_1.pdf).  

The DAO LLC structure, despite representing a forward leap in DAO-specific legislation, has garnered little adoption. The structure has been [criticized](https://substack.com/inbox/post/38187682) because of the tradeoffs it requires of DAOs and its general lack of suitability to DAO operations. Pass-through taxation, paperwork requirements, restrictions on manager-management, and the requirement of state representatives are all features of DAO LLCs that are considered to be against the notions of pseudonymity and flexibility that are fundamental to DAOs.

## What is a DUNA?
A Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) is a type of legal structure specifically designed for DAOs. DUNAs are established under [Wyoming’s DUNA Act](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050) which comes into effect on July 1, 2024. It represents the most recent leap towards creating a DAO-specific legal structure. 

On surface level, the name “DUNA” partly comes off as a misnomer. This is because of the “unincorporated” and “nonprofit” contained in its name. Despite this nomenclature, a DUNA is technically an [incorporated](https://carta.com/learn/startups/private-companies/incorporation/) entity in the sense that it has a separate legal personality. DUNAs can also engage in profit-making activities although this must ultimately be in furtherance of a non-profit purpose.

DUNAs can be thought of as an offspring and/or improved version of [UNAs](https://ballotpedia.org/Unincorporated_nonprofit_association) with slight modifications making it tailored to DAOs.

## What are the Key Features of a DUNA?
Pursuant to the Wyoming DUNA Act, DUNAs are legal entities with the following features and structure:
* **Separate Legal Entity**: DUNAs provide DAOs with legal existence, allowing them to exercise rights as a legal entity.[17-32-105](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050);[108](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050). Importantly, this enables DAOs to comply with tax and regulatory requirements. 

* **Limited Liability**: As a separate legal entity, a DUNA is distinct from its members. Therefore, the members of a DAO under the DUNA structure cannot be held liable for the actions of the DAO. [17-32-107](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050). This protection also extends to persons who are authorized to manage certain affairs of the DAO, referred to as Administrators. [17-32-102(a)(i)](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050).

* **Nonprofit Purpose**: DUNAs are [nonprofit organizations](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/npo-non-profit-organization/). This means that they must possess a nonprofit purpose.[17-32-104(a)](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050). This conveniently aligns with the ethos of many DAOs who set out to promote [public goods](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants/general-questions/what-are-public-goods) or benefits. The specific purpose(s) of a DUNA is governed by its Governing principles. [17-32-102(a)(vii)](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050). 

* **Distribution of Profits**: Despite their nonprofit status, DUNAs can engage in profit-making activities to the extent that its profits are channeled into its nonprofit purpose. As a result, DAOs cannot distribute profits to members under the DUNA structure. However, DAOs can pay “reasonable compensation” to members, administrators or third parties for services rendered. [17-32-104(c)(i)](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050). “Services” is not exhaustively defined in the DUNA Act and can range from voting on governance proposals to general participation in DAO activities. Profits can also be distributed to members in conformity with the DAOs nonprofit purpose. [17-32-104(c)(ii)](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050). Both these provisions have a broad interpretation to the advantage of DAOs, as the Act fails to provide any strict definitions. DAOs can potentially leverage these provisions to effectively distribute profits to its members. This transforms what appears to be one of the loopholes of the Act into one of its more appealing features.

* **Governing Principles**: As [articles](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/articles-of-association/) are to a corporation, Governing principles are to a DUNA. The Governing principles govern the purpose, operations, rights, duties in a DUNA. It is determined by the members, it doesn’t need to be contained in a single document and can be implied from practice. This is suitable to the modus operandi of DAOs who make operational decisions through governance proposals, forums, and discord channels. It allows DAOs operational flexibility without the hassle of formal documentation. [17-32-102(a)(vii)](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050).

* **Management Structure**: As [Directors](https://www.cgincorporations.com/blog/what-is-a-company-director/) are to a corporation, Administrators are to DUNAs, with the major difference being that Administrators are optional in DUNAs.[17-32-123](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050). Otherwise, members generally drive the operations of a DUNA.


## What Gives DUNAs an Edge Over Other Legal Structures?
### DUNAs vs The Corporation
Corporations require a centralized management body with fiduciary duties (i.e. Directors). This is antithetical to the “D” in “DAO”. Only Administrators come close to resembling Directors in a DUNA, and even so, the use of Administrators is merely optional. Additionally, DUNAs are largely free from the burdensome compliance procedures that corporations are subject to, allowing them a great deal of flexibility.

### DUNAs vs Foundations
Foundations require governance bodies such as a Board of Directors, Foundation Council or Guardians. This compromises decentralization for DAOs. There is no required governance body for a DUNA. Furthermore, setting up and maintaining offshore Foundations is expensive and requires filings - the opposite is true for DUNAs.

### DUNAs vs UNAs
DUNAs are quite literally decentralized UNAs. A DUNA being a DAO-specific legal structure makes it a better choice for DAOs than the ordinary UNA structure. This is because tailored legislation provides DAOs with clarity, protects them from the risks of potential amendments that alter the suitability of UNAs to DAOs, and allows for unique interpretation of rules.  

### DUNAs vs DAO LLCs
A DAO LLC subjects members pass-through taxation, while DUNAs do not. The counter-argument is that DAO LLCs can equally distribute profits to members while DUNAs cannot. However, DUNAs can compensate members, and the language and provisions of the DUNA Act is sufficiently wide enough to allow this to be done to a great degree. Additionally, membership arrangements (regarding transfer of rights, admission, removal, etc.) are flexible in a DUNA with no paperwork or filing requirements. Such requirements are obtainable in DAO LLCs. 

## What are the Pros and Cons of DUNAs?
### Pros
* **Decentralization**: DUNAs offer a way for DAOs to gain legal existence without compromising on decentralization and autonomy. DUNAs do not envisage a centralized management structure and it is up completely up to its members to steer the operations of the DUNA by defining its governing principles.

* **Regulatory Certainty**: By bringing DAOs under the laws of a state, the DUNA structure provides much-needed regulatory clarity and certainty. This is especially beneficial for DAOs that interact with the US economy. This approach is superior to adopting offshoring strategies (such as the Foundation structure) which can ultimately expose DAOs to US laws and unforeseen legal challenges. 

* **Simplicity**: When compared to other legal entity structures, DUNAs are exponentially cheaper to set up and maintain, requiring no state filings or registration fees. DUNAs also have an easy to understand structure. This allows DAOs to maintain flexibility and smooth operations without cumbersome requirements.

### Cons
* **Novelty**: The DUNA is a new type of legal entity. This comes with its own risks. For all their undesirable features, traditional legal entity structures have been firmly established through years of judicial precedents, which gives them a degree of reliability and predictability which DUNAs cannot yet boast of.

* **Ambiguity**: The Wyoming DUNA Act contains some ambiguities that could lead to legal dispute in the future. For example, the Act does not define “reasonable compensation” for members or what it means for a DUNA to “confer benefits to members in conformity with its nonprofit purpose”.[17-32-104(c)](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0050). These provisions are open to wide interpretation and require clearer definitions. This is key to prevent DAOs from being found in violation of the Act due to wrong application of these provisions.

## Conclusion
The DUNA is a new kind of legal structure that represents a significant leap forward from traditional DAO legal wrappers. DUNAs provide DAOs with legal existence, the ability to comply with tax and regulatory requirements, and limited liability for DAO members. DUNAs confer these benefits on DAOs while allowing them maintain their ethos of decentralization and permissionlessness by empowering members as the driving force of DAOs. In contrast to conventional legal wrappers, DUNAs offer DAOs regulatory certainty especially within the United States and are much simpler to establish and manage. DUNAs therefore hold a lot of potential as the go-to legal wrapper for DAOs and DAOs can leverage on the DUNA structure to establish their legal status.
