# How to Buy an NFT Using SAFE on OpenSea
## Step 1 - Get the wallet connect link
Go to OpenSea to the NFT you wish to purchase and enter the page for the NFT.  Click "login" at the top right corner.  Click on Wallet Connect.  When you do, a window with a QR code will appear.  In the top right corner of that window will be a "copy" icon.  Click it to add to your clipboard.

## Step 2 - Go to your SAFE account and log in
Log into your SAFE and click the dApp icon in the top menu bar.  It looks like a 'w'.  When you click this icon, a window will appear that shows an input field with the text 'wc' in the field.  Paste the link from OpenSea into this bar and hit the "Paste" button.

This should now show a connection to the NFT you were looking at.

## Step 3 - Confirm the purchase
From within the SAFE Application main browser window a message will appear that asks for confirmation of your multisig connection to OpenSea.  Sign it.  If you require multiple signatures it is **IMPORTANT** that this window will need to remain open until the threshold is met.  

## Step 4 - Let me know how it goes
I'm not actually buying an NFT in this case so I cannot continue further down the purchase path, but I imagine it will be pretty straight forward from here.  If you need additional help, the flow from this point forward should look like this artice from [Safe's Knowledge Base](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/108235-how-to-connect-a-safe-to-a-dapp-using-walletconnect)
