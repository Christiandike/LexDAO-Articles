# Introducing LexDAO.org and The First Legal Engineer Certified Personal Token Factory

![](https://i.imgur.com/oHjFnpI.png)

One of our underlying goals at LexDAO is to develop a library of Web 3 tools we stand behind. Today we're launching the new version of https://lexdao.org and our first "certified" dApp, a [personal token factory](https://lexdao.org/#/personal-token). Visit the site to learn more about LexDAO, and othewise.... on to the personal tokens!

## Why Personal Tokens?

People and their business relationships are pretty much all online these days. But, the dynamic of working relationships hasn't changed much. We think personal tokens are core infrastructure to drive this change, and a good way to start is to focus on "consulting". There's a lot of overhead we think we can reduce in the space.

Imagine if you could turn yourself into a vending machine on the internet. You could retain complete control over how you price your time or let the market determine how much your minute is worth. Your pricing was completely in your control. That's the hype behind the "Personal Token" everyone has been talking about.

A Personal Token is basically an offer to provide consulting services to people who redeem them. The goal is to map readily onto different ways of thinking about the relationship. With tokens we can ultimately take part in markets that reflect dealings over time, and capture the value inherent in possible network effects.

Built on Web 3, these tokens are true digital property that can be sent anywhere in the world and never copied. Built by a bunch of legal engineers, so you can trust them to be legally predictable.

## Legal Predictability & Built in Protections or, "Why should I use your version?"

This is a token factory built by legal engineers. We're built in a number of things to make the Personal Token easier and safer to use. Including:

**Default Terms of Service:**
If this personal token economy is ever going to work, it needs to play nice with the existing business and legal structures. In the real world, consultants use engagement agreements, and terms of service to protect themselves against all kinds of things. These agreements set expectations, and also the understanding of what happens if something goes wrong. This is what we call "legal predictability."

If you're a consultant and already have docs for this, üëç you can use your URL. If not our dApp will automatically generate a TOS document for you, and attach it to your token Smart Contract. Becuase our dApp does this we're able to say that your token will always fall under the protection of meatspace laws. Worst case, you can bring in the lawyers. Although we sure how we can all get along better than that.

**Dispute Resolution:**
Alas, sometimes we won't get along. And no one *actually* wants to bring in the lawyers. Even with a contract, things still go wrong. This is why we've built in LexDAO powered dispute resolution. 

If anything goes wrong with your token, LexDAO is able to pause your token contract, and arbitrate the dispute as a DAO. (But only via DAO vote.)

**Stardardized Values:**
Simply put, this means we've made a bunch of other choices for simplicity and legal interoperability. Here's what they are:
* 1 Token = 1 Minute of Your Time 
* Initial Offering: 60,000 Tokens (1,000 Hrs)
* Total Cap: 240,000 Tokens (4,000 Hrs)
* Decimal places: 6
* LexDAO Fee: .0009 ETH

## Why Standardized Values?
**Easy of use:**
We think a minute is the most competent atomic unit of a consulting relationship. (And really, the only thing of real value in the world, but that's a philosophy lecture.) Our scheme aims to deal with minimum practical decimal places. An hour is 60 tokens. That's our starting scheme.

**Fungibility:** 
When we get to a point of swapping personal tokens, having standard terms and standard units of measurement will make personal token swaps as easy as cash. Six decimal places gives us pretty good prescicion in streaming, while still being readable on a damn device. üòé

**Fee:**- 
We built this. We keep it ship shape. You can throw us a .0009 ETH bone, no?d

4. If you have any trouble with this you can always reach a LexDAO member to help at http://lexdao.chat
 
### Name Your Token

The second step is the hardest, naming your token and selecting a token ticker symbol. We suggest your name and initials, for clarity. But go crazy with it, if you want.

### (Optional)

If you already have a TOS or Consulting Agreement you use, put in link to the document. We'll attach it to your token code.

Also, you might want to associate an email with your issuance. It's not required, but if you include it we'll add you to internal directy. (See the post on the the page for why this ight matter, hint: it's legal stuff.
