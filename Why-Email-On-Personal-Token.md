# Why you might want to attach an email to your Personal Token

It's about what lawyers call "notice" requirments. They're a blessing and a curse. You can't sue someone without serving them notice. Which means you need to know how to contact them. At the same time, you can't get a class action settlement check if no one knows how to contact you.

Adding an email address will tie your personal token to that address for the purpose of notices. Tying a token to your email address means it will likely be tied to other personal idenifying information.
